# What datavizkit is and isn't 

## Is

* a React wrapper for Highcharts, creating a clean separation of concerns and allowing for maximum ease and agility to change or extend variations of widgets


## Isn't 

* an API Interface that hides away the Highcharts api, we still require users to compile their own Highcharts api configurations for series, xAxis and yAxis
