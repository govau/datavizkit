# What datavizkit is and isn't

## Is

* a React wrapper for Highcharts, creating a clean separation of concerns and allowing for maximum ease and agility to change or extend variations of widgets


## Isn't

* an API Interface that hides away the Highcharts api, we still require users to compile their own Highcharts api configurations for series, xAxis and yAxis


## Could be

 * Data Interface controllers for widget varieties
   * what type of data I want - percentage axis etc

 * Said templates
